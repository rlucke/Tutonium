About:
Tutonium is an extension of the selenium ide, which allows you 
to create webbased tutorials.


Requirements:
All you need is an up to date version of Firefox 
(http://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/) and the Selenium IDE 
plug-in (http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/).


Install:
To run Tutonium you need firefox and the selenium ide plug-in. 
After unpacking the tutonium.xpi file just open it with firefox 
and click on the install button. After restarting firefox you 
will find tutonium in your selenium ide plug-in.


Usage:
To create a tutorial you need to build test cases. Each case 
represents a task (tab) in the tutorial. First you have to 
discribe the task. Use selenium command storeText and put some 
text into the value field.

Tutonium gives you the opportunity to check solutions. Commands
like verifyElementPresent, verifyTextPresent, verifyText, 
verifyLocation and verifyPath enables tutonium's checking 
function. Furthermore you have the chance to display a help. 
The clickAndWait command enables tutonium's helper function.
